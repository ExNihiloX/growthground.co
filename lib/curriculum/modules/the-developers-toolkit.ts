        coreExplanation: [
          "Forget complex code. Think of Git as Google Docs for code, but with superpowers.",
          "Your entire codebase is stored in a Repository (Repo), which is like a main project folder hosted on a service like GitHub or GitLab. When a developer makes a change, they don't just \"save\". They take a snapshot of the changes called a Commit. Each commit has a unique ID and a message describing what was changed (e.g., \"Added a new login button\"). This creates a detailed, chronological history of your entire project.",
          "The real power comes from Branches. Imagine you want to add a new feature. Instead of working on the main main document, you create a copy, or a \"branch,\" called feature/new-checkout. You can make all your changes on this branch safely, without affecting the live, working version of the app.",
          "Once the feature is complete and tested on its branch, you create a Pull Request (PR). This is like saying, \"Hey team, I'm done with my changes on this branch. Please review them.\" Other developers can look at the code and leave comments. Once everyone agrees it's good, you Merge the branch, combining your new feature into the main main codebase, ready for deployment."
        ],
        strategicInsights: [
          "Risk Mitigation: Git is your ultimate undo button. You can revert to any previous version of your app instantly, which is invaluable when a bug goes live. A clear commit history helps pinpoint exactly where a bug was introduced.",
          "Team Velocity: Git allows your entire development team to work in parallel on different features without overwriting each other's work, dramatically increasing productivity and reducing \"merge conflicts.\"",
          "Code Quality & Onboarding: The Pull Request process is a powerful quality assurance and knowledge-sharing tool. It ensures multiple sets of eyes have reviewed code and helps new developers learn the codebase by seeing how others work."

          "Think of the Command Line Interface (CLI) as a pilot's cockpit. A passenger interacts with a simple, graphical interface (the seatback screen). It's easy but limited. The pilot uses a complex cockpit with direct access to all the plane's systems. It requires training, but it offers ultimate power and control.",
          "The command line is the same. Instead of clicking on folders and icons, developers type text commands to perform actions. For example, cd my-project to 'change directory' into a folder, or npm install to install a new piece of software.",
          "Why use this? Speed, power, and automation. Developers can chain commands together to perform complex sequences of tasks. They can write Scriptsâ€”short programs that automate repetitive work, like running tests or deploying a new version of the app to a server. Most importantly, nearly all web servers are managed exclusively through the command line, making it an essential skill."
